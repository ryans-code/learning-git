A student has established the following monthly budget:

Housing               500.00
Utilities             150.00
Transportation         50.00
Food                  250.00
Entertainment         150.00
Miscellaneous          50.00

Write a program that stores the following data about each budget category in a 
structure called Category:
• The name of the category 
• The amount allocated to the category 
• The amount spent on that category so far this month

The program should keep an array of these structures, one per category. When the 
program runs, it should initialize the array using the data above, and 0 for the amount 
spent so far this month.

Then it should repeat a loop that performs the following steps: The user is prompted to 
choose one of the following options: select a category (1 through 6), display the table 
(7), or quit(8). When a category is selected, the user will enter an amount of money to 
be added to the amount spent on that category so far this month. When option (7) is 
selected, the user should see a table of the categories with the allocated amounts, the 
amount spent so far this month, and the amount over budget for that category (if there 
is money left for that category, it should display as a negative number). The amount 
over budget should be calculated from the other values. 

When the user quits the program (8), the program should display a message indicating 
the amount over or under for the entire monthly budget. 

The program must include three functions: 
• one to display the table, 
• one to process the user’s selected category (to input the amount and add it to the 
category), and 
• one to determine the amount over or under budget for the month. 
These functions should take an array of Category (and perhaps other values) as 
arguments.
